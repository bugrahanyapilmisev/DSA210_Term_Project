# Motivation
# My Chess.com Usage Data Analysis
Since 2019, I have been playing chess regularly on chess.com. After enrolling in this course and learning about the term project, I wondered if there might be a connection between the frequency of my chess playing and my stress levels. Since chess.com is the only platform where I play chess, I can easily access the data related to my games.

With this in mind, I plan to analyze the changes in my chess activity frequency on chess.com and my stress levels from the day I started university to the present. To evaluate variations in my stress levels, I will consider the academic intensity of my university life. So I hypothesize that I generally experience higher stress levels during exam periods and lower levels during holidays.

By the end of my project, I want to uncover whether there is a meaningful relationship between these two variables. This study could provide valuable insights into how I cope with stress.

## Data Source

I have one main source of data:

-   Data that is directly exported from Chess.com as a personal [data request](https://www.chess.com/games/archive).
  
    a-) This dataset contains information about every game I have played in chess.com. For example, it contains ratings of players, movements, time info,            results, which player plays as black or white, etc. 


In addition to this data source, to estimate my stress level I have collected all my exam dates. I have found these dates in my SabancÄ± University email account.
